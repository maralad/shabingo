          <h3>Shabingo is a way for people who have quality video content to make Serious money... </h3>
          <h3>And here is how...</h3>
        <h4>Shabingo is kind of a mix between Youtube and Ebay.
        Its a web platform which allows anybody to upload a video with a preview clip.
        People watch the preview and when the preview finishes they are asked...
        <h2>Do you want to see the Full Shabingo?</h2>
        <h4></h4>
        <h3>So If they find the preview captivating or compelling enough, they pay a few dollars to see
        the rest of the movie. Thereafter  they get unlimited streaming access for that particular clip.
        In addition the user can read comments and ratings about the video before deciding to pay for it.
       </h3>  
       <h4></h4>
        <h3>
        The video could be a tutorial, a movie, a song, a niche "how to" video for professionals and
        trades people.
        </h3>
        <h3></h3>
        It could be anything at all as long as the preview clip captivates the user enough to pay to view the full Shabingo! 
        <h3></h3>
        </h3>
        <h4>
        Creativity is the major factors in how entrepreneurs make the most of this platform.
        </h3>
