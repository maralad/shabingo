        <h2>Firstly, this is a free service. Shabingo now charges Zero commission and no ongoing charges for its service.</h2> 
        <h3>If you make Videos and would like to get paid, then Shabingo is the place for you. .</h3>
            <h3>
        A video to upload and make money from on Shabingo could be a tutorial, a movie, a song, a niche "how to" video for professionals and
        trades people. Or whatever you think people would pay to watch.
        </h3>
          <h3>The reason Shabingo was created was to facilitate people who created niche videos that had a lot of value to 
          some people but not to millions of people or the masses. If your videos appeal to millions you can make good ad revenue on YouTube.
          However that is a very tiny minority.</h3>
          <h3>For example YouTube's CPM is reported to be on average 7.6$, that means you get paid 7.6$ for each 1,000 views.</h3>
          <h3>That is quite good if you manage to get 100,000 views then you make 760 dollars. That is all good if you can manage to consistently get all those views.  <h3>
          <h2><i>But let me show you how Niche videos do so much better on Shabingo.com ...</i></h2>
            <h3><strong>Example:</strong></h3>
            <h3>Say you were a Jeweller who put up a video on youtube showing how to change the movement on a certain watch. 
            This is a very niche video that could be very valuable to certain jewellers.
            However you would only get at best about 2000 views over a couple of years for this video on YouTube as this is very niche.
            That would make you about 14 dollars over the 2 years.
            <h3>
            <h3>The thing is many of the jewellers who watched that video would probably have been more than happy to pay 20 dollars to access that video.
            So if half of them were willing to pay 20 dollars each you would have made $20,000 instead of $14.</h3>
            
        <h2><strong>This is where Shabingo comes in...</strong></h2>
        <h2>Shabingo a video platform which allows anybody to upload a video with a preview clip.
        People watch the preview and when the preview finishes they are asked...
        <h3>Do you want to see the Full Shabingo?</h3>
        <h3></h3>
        <h3>So If they find the preview captivating or compelling enough, they pay a few dollars to see
        the rest of the movie. Thereafter  they get unlimited streaming access for that particular clip.
        In addition the user can read comments and ratings about the video before deciding to pay for it.
       </h3>  
       <h3></h3>
        <h3>
        The video could be a tutorial, a movie, a song, a niche "how to" video for professionals and
        trades people.
        </h3>
        <h3></h3>
        <h3>
        It could be anything at all as long as the preview clip captivates the user enough to pay to view the full Shabingo! 
        </h3>
           <h3>   </h3>
        <h3>
        Creativity is the major factor in how entrepreneurs make the most of this platform.
