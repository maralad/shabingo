            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The best video platforms 
                <span class="text-muted">To sell your content on...</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are actualy lots of different video platforms where you can upload your videos and get paid directly by the viewer for your content. Lets take a look and see what they each offer regarding fees, commission, premiums etc.</p>
                        
            <p class="lead"><strong>Shabingo.com</strong></p>
            <p class="lead">Shabingo.com is a free service to sign up to. 
            The only fee you have to pay is a flat commission rate of 23% of any sale you make.
            How it works is you upload a video with a preview. When people view the preview they are 
            asked at the end of the preview if they want to watch the full Shabingo.
            Now the cool thing about Shabingo is that you have a choice if you want to watch the whole video...
            <strong>You can either pay the nominal price to watch the video or you can share the video on either facebook or twitter.</strong>
            Whats cool about that for an uploader is that if they 
            coose to pay, well thats great you get paid and if they decide 
            to share well depending on how many facebook friends or twitter 
            followers they have <strong>your video is now shared into hundreds or 
            possibly thousands of social media feeds from one click</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead"><strong>GUMROAD</strong></p> 
            <p class="lead">What gumroad does is it provides you with the tools to get paid for any digital content. So it could be e-books , images, videos etc. They provide you with the tools but do not provide you with any traffic. That is up to you. It is good for using it in conjunction with your existing site.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead"><strong>Pivotshare</strong></p> 
            <p class="lead">Pivotshare allows you to create your own subscription video on demand channel. Again you have to ge your own traffic. They take a commission of 30%</p>
             <br>
            <p class="lead"><strong>Vimeo</strong></p> 
            <p class="lead">Vimeo lets you put a tip jar with your videos if you sign u to their on demand premium service which will cost you $199 plus 10% commission. Your account also has to be in good standing according to their guide lines. </p>
             <br>
            <p class="lead"><strong>StreamingVideosOnline</strong></p> 
            <p class="lead">StreamingVideosOnline allows you to sell videos online from your own
