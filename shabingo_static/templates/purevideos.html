       <p>Why I started Shabingo</p>
          <div>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">Shabingo came to me in a dream! </span></div>
<div>
	Yes I know. I just happen to be one of those people crazy enough to follow my dream.
        OK so the site is not ready but I want to keep this page updated so that I can let
        people know the progress I am making and also how as a community we will be able to
        help each other make money from our video creations. by the way if you're not already familiar with what Shabingo is then <a href="http://shabingo.com/about-us/"> Please Click Here</a></div>

	<span style="font-size:16px;">A little background about me first.</span></div>
<div>
	I am a seriel entreperneur. Thankfully I have a background in software and before setting up various businesses &nbsp;over the past 13 years I worked as a software Engineer for a few years. I was very comfortable in my last business where I owned a chain of computer stores. The only thing is I was getting very bored and of course I had this crazy shabingo dream to follow. So seen as I always kept in touch with software and I have actually written a number of Android Apps and pleanty of websites over the past few years. This is my first web app for about 14 years though and the technology I used for writing web apps 14 years ago was ASP. I am wwriting this web app using python which I am thourouly enjoying. It is a great language, easy to learn, and very scaleable. So when Shabingo becomes monster big we will be able to handle it as everything I am doing right now while I design and code shabingo is keeping scaleability in mind.&nbsp;</div>
