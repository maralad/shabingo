<h2>
    <a name="privacy"></a>
    3. Privacy
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>General</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <p>
        We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from
        unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for
        permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours,
        and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
    </p>
</ul>
<p>
    We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to
    secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain
    secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through
insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at    <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself
    against identity theft.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will
    revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal
    information, we will notify you by sending an email to the email address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we
    do not have such an email address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website. We recommend that you check our website from time
    to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.

<h5>
    Cookies:
</h5>
<p>
    A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies.
    A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your
    hard drive for an extended period of time.
</p>
<p>
    For example, when you sign in to our website, we will record your user or member ID and the name on your user or member account in the cookie file on your
    computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For
    security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of
    sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service providers to serve
    cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content
    and advertising.
</p>
<p>
    You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of
    the features and services of our website may not function properly.
</p>
<p>
    We may allow third-parties, including IAC companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use
    tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any
    personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on
    the advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this
    information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy.
    This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be
    advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member
    companies (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org</a>).

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Storage Limits</strong>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    <strong>TERMINATION FOR BREACH:</strong>
    Shabingo may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) or block or remove any content you submitted if Shabingo determines that you
    have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage Shabingo's reputation and goodwill. If Shabingo deletes
    your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for the Shabingo Service. Shabingo may block your email address and Internet protocol
    address to prevent further registration.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>EFFECT OF TERMINATION/ACCOUNT DELETION:</strong>
    Upon termination, all licenses granted by Shabingo will terminate. Sections 6 and 11 though 16 shall survive termination. In the event of account deletion
